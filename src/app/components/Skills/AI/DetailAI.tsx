        ðŸ§  I actively integrate AI into real-world applications, focusing on
        real-time audio and voice streaming technologies. My work includes
        implementing intelligent systems that utilize speech processing and
        image generation, enhancing user interactivity and automation. Iâ€™m
        especially interested in leveraging OpenAIâ€™s capabilities for building
        conversational and perceptive interfaces, embedding AI into user
        experiences where latency and reliability are critical.
